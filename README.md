## AI-Driven Employee Wellness and Productivity Tracker

## Introduction

- The Employee Performance Tracking System (EPTS) is designed to manage and evaluate employee performance in a structured and efficient manner. It provides companies with the ability to track performance data, generate reports, and provide feedback to employees.
- The system aims to automate performance evaluation, reduce manual errors, and promote transparency in employee assessments.



## Objective:
Build an AI-based platform that tracks employee productivity metrics (e.g., project completion rates, time spent on tasks) and correlates them with wellness data (e.g., stress levels, absenteeism, survey responses).

## Novelty: 
The platform should suggest personalized interventions (break times, counseling) and productivity boosters using AI models trained on behavioral data.

## Enterprise Use: 
Improves employee well-being and enhances productivity across teams.
